We're very excited - not just because of the inordinate amount of caffeine based products consumed - 
but also because our team are putting together 
the final missing parts to the biggest Google related online event.

So should you also be excited? Well yes... and here's why!

* **Attendance**: we're expecting over 5000 attendees
* **Topic**: more than 10 hours of announcements of videogames 
* **Date**: 1st of September
* **Speakers**: we're in the process of finalising the list of speakers

but we've already secured a first batch of experts:

* **Hideo Kojima**<br>
* **Shigeru Miyamoto**<br>
* **Andrew Wilson**<br>
* **Sam Houser**<br>
* **Sundar Pichai**<br>
